# Calc X

**Instructions**:
* Look through the starting files provided in this repository. You will find the logic of the calculator app in `percentage.js` and `aspect-ratio.js`. 
* Import the files to `index.js` and add the functionality to the UI in the `index.js` file.
* Do not forget to add the `index.js` file at the end of the `index.html` file.


**Hints**
* in index.js you have to use or bind some eventListeners (.addEventListener) to add the functionality
* your eventListeners could listen to "change", "input" or suchlike
* if you have trouble with the eventListers check the exercise we already made: https://github.com/BER-FBW25/Browser-Calculator


**Notes**:
* Deadline: ~ 1hr-1.5hrs

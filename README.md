# Calc X

**Instructions (ENG)**:
SHORT:
Implement the functionality of an already prepared calculator app by mainly using exports and imports.  

DETAIL: 
* Look through the starting files provided in this repository. In the `index.html` you'll find some markup for a simple calclulator App. You will also find the logic of the necessary calculations in the _modules_ folder in `percentage.js`. 
* Import the functions to `index.js` and add the functionality in the `index.js` file.
* Do not forget to add the `index.js` file at the end of the `index.html` file.


**Hints**
* in index.js you have to use or bind some eventListeners (.addEventListener) to add the functionality
* your eventListeners could listen to "change", "input" or suchlike
* You can add one eventListener to the whole form (instead of each input) which will listen to all input changes of the form. E.g. ```document.querySelector('.myForm').addEventListener('input', ()=> {
  alert('Input changed!');
})``` 
The alert will be triggered at any change on any input element of .myForm (ask your good looking teacher if you don't get this point)

**Notes**:
* Deadline: ~ 1hr-1.5hrs
